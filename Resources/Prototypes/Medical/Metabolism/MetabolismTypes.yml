  energyReagent: "Sugar" #TODO metabolism: add glucose and swap this to use it
  #Average human blood sugar concentration is 0.055 mol/RU, converted this is 6.3514%. I rounded up to 6.5 because it's nicer.
  #This makes the "healthy" glucose level for humans at 16.25 RU, if humans have 250 RU of blood.
  targetEnergyReagentConcentration: 0.065

  #Molar volume of glucose is 115.48ml/mole with a Caloric density of 686 KCal (https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/nursing-and-health-professions/caloric-density)
  #SS14 uses DeciLitres for units so 115.48ml is 1.1548 RU. 686/1.1548 = 594.0422584 which gives us RU per KCal,
  #rounding it up to 595 to keep the numbers nicer
