# Rule: Defining the codebase prefix, project folder and edit markers

This rule is mandatory for any task in the SS14 forks of the Sunrise/Fire/Fish/Lust family.

## 1. What you need to determine before starting work

Before analyzing, planning paths and making changes, always fix three values:

1. Active codebase prefix (`Sunrise`, `Fire`, `Fish`, `Lust`).
2. Forked project folder (`_Sunrise`, `_Scp`, `_Fish`, `_Lust`).
3. The text of the edit marker that should be used in comments.

Don't start editing vanilla files until these three values ​​are defined.

## 2. How to determine the current fork

Define a fork by collecting all concrete signals before choosing:

1. Git remote repository slug: the last repository name in the remote URL, for example `project-fire` in `space-sunrise/project-fire`.
2. The name of the repository root folder and the path of the working directory.
3. Which forked project folder is actually present in the code base (`_Sunrise`, `_Scp`, `_Fish`, `_Lust`) near the files being changed.
4. The nearest existing edit markers in the adjacent code.

Do not infer the fork from the GitHub organization or owner name alone. `space-sunrise` is an organization name, not proof that the codebase is Sunrise. If the repository slug is `project-fire` or the active project folder is `_Scp`, select Fire even when the owner is `space-sunrise`.

If the signals diverge:

1. Priority goes to the exact repository slug and the actual project folder used by the code being changed.
2. If an exact fork signal exists (`project-fire`, `_Scp`, Fire markers), it overrides generic Sunrise-looking signals such as the organization name, an old root folder name, or a mirror remote.
3. Do not mix markers from different forks within the same task.

## 3. Correspondence map

Select the first line that matches the exact repository slug, the name of the root folder, alias, actual fork folder, or local edit markers. Repository slug means the repository name itself, not the organization/owner part of the URL.

| Match | Prefix | Project folder | Single-line marker | Block markers | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sunrise-station/space-station-14`, `space-sunrise/sunrise-station`, `sunrise-station`, `_Sunrise` | `Sunrise` | `_Sunrise` | `Sunrise-Edit` | `Sunrise edit start/end`, `Sunrise added start/end` | For new single placemarks, default to `Sunrise-Edit`. |
| `fire-station/project-fire`, `project-fire`, `fire-station`, `_Scp` | `Fire` | `_Scp` | `Fire edit`, `Fire added` | `Fire edit start/end`, `Fire added start/end` | For Fire, single edit/add marks are different. |
| `fish-station`, `_Fish` | `Fish` | `_Fish` | `FIsh edit` | Use local file style | Don't automatically normalize the legacy token case. |
| `lust-lustation`, `_Lust` | `Lust` | `_Lust` | `Lust edit` | Use local file style | If there is already a block-style nearby inside Lust, follow it. |

## 4. How to apply a marker in a specific file

The same general rules apply for any fork:

1. Use `Prefix`, `Project folder` and `marker` from the selected table row.
2. Do not change the marker text, just adapt the comment syntax to the file language.
3. If the file already uses a local style of the same fork, continue with it. Don't repurpose old markers just for cosmetics.

Select the comment syntax to match the file language:

- C#, C++, Java: `// Sunrise-Edit`, `// Fire added start - reason`
- YAML, FTL, Python, Shell: `# Sunrise-Edit`, `# Fire added start - reason`
- XML, HTML: `<!-- Sunrise-Edit -->`, only if comments in this format are allowed and really needed

## 5. How does this affect the structure of edits?

1. Place new forked files in the corresponding project folder of the current fork.
2. Mark minimal hooks in vanilla files with the edit marker of the current fork.
3. Don't put the Sunrise code in `_Scp` and don't use `Fire edit` in `_Sunrise`.
4. If a project is already mixing historical marker variants within one fork, for new edits follow the closest local style of that fork, but do not switch to markers from another fork.
